# schoolprojects
This is a list of projects I have worked on while in the MBA program at Syracuse University. My MBA concentration is Business Analytics. 

The Intro to DS Project:

Implemented a data analytics project using R to analyze and predict house prices. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing information about various houses, including features like carpet area, number of bathrooms, balconies, furnishing status, and location.
We used multiple regression to analyze this data and identify variables that were statistically significant.

Foodie Express:

Created a comprehensive database schema for the 'FoodieExpress' system.
Defined tables for users, addresses, restaurants, menu items, orders, and bills.
Established foreign key relationships for data integrity.

Inserted sample data for addresses, users, restaurants, menu items, and order details.
Utilized SQL scripts to populate the database with meaningful sample information.

Implemented a trigger to update the 'Bills' table when new orders are inserted into 'OrderItems'.
Developed a stored procedure for updating user information, allowing password and email changes.
Created a function to extract billing information for a specific user.

Constructed views for pending orders and restaurant menus, providing convenient data access.

Utilized indexing for optimizing searches related to restaurant names in the 'MenuItems' table.
